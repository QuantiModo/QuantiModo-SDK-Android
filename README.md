QuantiModo-SDK-Android
======================

This is the software development kit for implementing enabling Android Applications to store or access user Quantified Self data in the QuantiModo database.

For detailed documenation, check out the [JavaDocs](http://quantimodo.github.io/QuantiModo-SDK-Android/javadoc/)!

###QuantiModo-Android
At QuantiModo, data from a variety of applications can be integrated and analyzed to help you discover hidden correlations between your mood, aspects of health, productivity and any of the countless variables that can affect them. 

An example application that QuantiModo supports is [MoodiModo for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.moodimodo&hl=en). MoodiModo allows users to easily track their mood on a regular basis using a unique pop-up interface. Feel free to [fork it](https://github.com/mikepsinn/MoodiModo-Android) and modify to track whatever you want!

Rooted users can also install [Quantimodo Sync for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.quantimodo.sync&hl=en).  Quantimodo Sync facilitates the uploading of life-tracking data from a wide array of Android life-tracking applications. 

## How to data from your users from inside your Android app

### Step 1: Create a QuantiModo API app

Sign up at for an account at the [Mashape developer portal](https://market.mashape.com/quantimodo/quantimodo) and create your app.  Click the "GET THE KEYS" button for your app in the upper right hand corner. Email mike@quantimo.do with the name of your app and I'll send you a client_id and client_secret. 

Then make a copy of the properties file in the root of this repo and add your Mashape key, client id, and client secret there.

### Step 2: Add the QuantiModo API Android client library

Install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/studio.html). This comes with the Gradle dependency manager is used for the installation of external libraries required for the QuantiModo SDK library.

1. Clone the repository using Android Studio (VCS -> Checkout from Version Control -> Github). Select your repository.

2. Open the project, when prompted import the project from Gradle. Select "Use default gradle wrapper".
3. Open Gradle and run the "signingReport" Gradle task. 
4. Open the Gradle Console and copy the number after SHA1 (your debug signature generated from your keystore file).
5. Don't let anyone get your keystore file.

4. Add your debug signature to the "ALLOWED_COOKIE_SIGNATURES" array in TokenManager. Only apps signed with these key signatures can put or get cookies.  If you ever leak your keystore you have to remove its signature from that array.
5. Remove all the `:` and make all the letters lowercase or you'll get an exception.  
6. Add a comment next to your signature that indicates who's it is, and what it's for.

7. Increase your versionCode and versionName in the /app/build/build.gradle file.

### Step 3: Add a link to the Import Data page

### Step 3: Authenticate your first user

A user authenticates QuantiModo Connect by clicking the Connect Data button and authenticating their data directly with your application. Create a menu link called "Import Data" which links to a page containing a webview of the page https://app.quantimo.do/api/connect.js.

### Step 4: Query a user's data

Once you have an accessToken, you can start querying your userâ€™s data. To do this, first import the client class and configure QuantiModoAPIClient.

## Testing
- Install your new APK.
- Create a new account in the QuantiModo app.
- Log into QuantiModo.
- Authorize your app to send measurements to QuantiMo.do.
- Send a measurement from your application.
- Check to see that it shows up here: https://quantipress.quantimo.do
- If you don't see it, debug or contact android@quantimo.do.
- If you do see your measurement, then you should be good to publish.

### Gradle SDK Distribution 
The SDK can be found in the [Sonatype Central Repository](https://oss.sonatype.org/#nexus-search;quick~quantimodo) for open-source software.
